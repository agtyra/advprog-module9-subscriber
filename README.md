1. **What is AMQP?**

   AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open, standardized application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. It defines how messages are structured, routed, and delivered between producers and consumers, ensuring reliable, interoperable, and secure communication across different platforms.

2. **What does `guest:guest@localhost:5672` mean?**

   - **Username (`guest`)**: the user name for authenticating with the AMQP broker.  
   - **Password (`guest`)**: the password for that user.  
   - **Host (`localhost`)**: the machine where the broker is running.
   - **Port (`5672`)**: the TCP port on which the broker listens for AMQP connections (5672 is the default port).
